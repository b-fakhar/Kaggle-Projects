# Kaggle-Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)
# Problem Statement:
A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients.

The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors, their properties, a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s).

A professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. In developing countries, the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRI. Automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Therefore, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Transfer Learning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.

# Objective:
- Provide an automated tool to detect and classify brain tumors.

- Design a highly accurte Deep Learning (DL) pipeline since this is a medical related problem and error can be really costly. 

# Dataset:

- This Kaggle project has one training folder and one testing folder, which contain MRI data. 

- Each folder has four subfolders that contain MRIs of respective tumor classes.
